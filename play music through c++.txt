1. First open codeblocks.
2. Then,
	go to setting -> compiler -> linker -> type "-lwinmm" in "other linker option" box -> press ok.
	
	(In Dev C++ you have to set linker everytime when you are creating a new project 
	 but in codeblocks you just need to create linker only once).

3. Now, create a new project of "console application"
4. Convert your music file into .wav extension.
5. Move the converted music file into the project folder.
6. Paste the below code snippet in code file of the project,

#include<iostream>
#include<windows.h>
#include<mmsystem.h>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	PlaySound(TEXT("file name with extension"), NULL, SND_SYNC);
	
	return 0;
}
